# Pyglet Project Spinoffs

This repo was design to be a starting point for pyglet projects. Each directory within the ``projects/`` directory could be their own repo. Those developers who choose to do this are encouraged to change this file and create a pull request with the change so everyone can enjoy the fun!


## Primary Project Spinoffs

These are projects which started with code in ``pyglet_projects`` and then grew to be __AMAZING!__

* [snake]()


## Secondary Project Spinoffs

These projects use pyglet but are not directly related to ``pyglet_projects``.
